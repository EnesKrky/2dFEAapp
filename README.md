# 2dFEAapp
2D finite element analysis application that uses linear triangles with manual meshing<br /><br />

###Controls###<br />
c: Removes all points, triangles, forces, and fixed points<br />
r: Refines selected triangle<br />
p: Hides or shows nodes<br />
q: Terminates the program<br />
1: Shows stress results while viewing solution<br />
2: Shows displacement results while viewing solution<br /><br />
If you click on the heat bar, it also switches between stress and displacement results.<br />
If you use mouse wheel to zoom in or out while the cursor is near middle of the screen, it just zooms in or out. Otherwise, it also changes position of the camera in a direction according to position of the cursor.<br />
In the material section, you should enter Young's Modulus, Poisson's Ratio, and thickness.
